# api-example
This repository contains example of user authentication using api
## DEMO
To test this code you don't have to do anything because I provided live domo: http://api-example.ddns.net
## OTP
Registration form uses OTP. The OTP is sent to users email address from **dishroller@gamil.com** 
(I didn't bother to create new email because  this is only an example ) the OTP is valid for 5 mins
